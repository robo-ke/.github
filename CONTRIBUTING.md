# Contributing

Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to this project. Your help is essential for keeping it great.

Contributions to this project are [released](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#6-contributions-under-repository-license) to the public under the project's open source license.

Please note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct. By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Reporting issues

Reporting issues are a great way to contribute to the project. We are perpetually grateful about a well-written, thorough bug report.

Before raising a new issue, check the issue list to determine if it already contains the problem that you are facing.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you for more information. Please be as detailed as possible.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Submitting a pull request

Good pull requests (e.g. patches, improvements, new features) are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid unrelated commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing new features, refactoring code etc.), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the maintainers might not want to merge into the project.

1. Fork and clone the repository, make sure you configure the remotes.
2. Configure and install the dependencies if necessary.
3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`s
4. Push to your fork and submit a pull request
5. Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Note that every commit you make must be signed. By signing off your work you indicate that you are accepting the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/).
- Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions). If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your commit automatically with `git commit -s`.
- Locally rebase the upstream development branch into your topic branch
- Follow standards for style and code quality.
- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Commit your changes in logical chunks. When you are ready to commit, make sure to write a Good Commit Message. Consult the [Conventional Commits guide](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) if you're unsure of what constitutes a Good Commit Message. Use [commitgpt](https://pypi.org/project/commitgpt/) to generate a Good Commit Message.
- Open your pull request against `main`
- It should pass all tests in the available continuous integration systems such as GitHub Actions.
